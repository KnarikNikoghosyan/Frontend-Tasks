<h3>The History of the Color Purple</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer do not support sticky positioning and Safari requires a -webkit- prefix.</p>
<p>Around 3,000 years ago, the Ancient Phoenicians discovered how to make a rich purple dye that became more brilliant over time. 
  Purple was worn exclusively by the upper class, and artists commissioned by the Catholic Church also depicted Jesus and the Virgin Mary in purple. 
  This exclusivity made purple a rare color among commoners until the Age of Enlightenment.
  The symbols of the Church and State hierarchy were not as valued at this time, and synthetic pigments made purple more available.
  Purple as the royal color started with ancient monarchies. The color was difficult to produce, which made it expensive and available only to upper society. Rulers wore purple robes and used purple ink to sign their edicts. Some Roman emperors penalized their citizens by death for wearing purple garments. 
  The use of purple among royalty decreased after the Byzantine empire fell in the 15th century.
  Purple stimulates the imagination, related to fantasies and dreams. As a result, purple can help people feel inspired and creative by getting them into the right mindset and sparking new ideas. Purple also has a physiological effect. It creates a feeling of calmness, lowering heart rate and blood pressure in some cases.
  However, excessive purple can cause feelings of frustration and aggravation.</p>
